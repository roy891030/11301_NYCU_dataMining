## 1_game_of_thrones
### Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a character's survival in the Game of Thrones universe using classification models.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting "Death Year" to binary data, and creating dummy variables for categorical features like allegiances.
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporating battle risk scores for each house based on historical data.
- **Modeling:** Decision Tree classification and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

### Results
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** 65.12%
- **XGBoost Cross-validation Score:** 72.3%
- **Final Kaggle Submission Score:** 73.16%

**Path:** `1_game_of_thrones/`

## 2_Sentiment_Analysis
### Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using both TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings with classification models.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Stop word removal, text tokenization, and converting scores to binary sentiment (positive/negative).
- **Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings to represent text data.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluating Random Forest and XGBoost models with k-fold cross-validation.

### Results
| Model | Cross-validation Accuracy | Kaggle Score |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Random Forest (TF-IDF) | 80.04% | 62.64% |
| XGBoost (TF-IDF) | 82.62% | 62.57% |
| Random Forest (Word2Vec) | 76.62% | 55.97% |
| XGBoost (Word2Vec) | 76.89% | 71.52% |

## 3_Time_Series_Regression
### Overview
This project predicts PM2.5 air pollution levels using time series regression models.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing value imputation with hourly averages, normalization, and splitting data into training (October/November) and testing (December) sets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating time-windowed features for 1-hour and 6-hour predictions.
- **Modeling:** Comparing Linear Regression and XGBoost models on single and multi-feature datasets.

### Results
| Model | 1-hour Prediction MAE | 6-hour Prediction MAE |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Linear Regression (PM2.5 only) | 2.67 | 4.31 |
| Linear Regression (All Features) | 2.65 | 4.27 |
| XGBoost (PM2.5 only) | 2.89 | 4.47 |
| XGBoost (All Features) | 2.81 | 4.62 |

## 4_Sentiment_Analysis_2
### Overview
This project builds deep learning models (CNN and LSTM) for sentiment classification on Yelp reviews.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Stop word removal, text tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **CNN Model:** Includes convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
- **LSTM Model:** Bidirectional LSTM layers with batch normalization, dense layers, and dropout for sequence modeling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Training and validation accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix analysis.

### Results
| Model | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| CNN | 87% | 75% |
| LSTM | 74% | 74% |

## 5_movieRating
### Overview
This project implements a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization to predict user movie ratings.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Randomized dataset splitting into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Using embedding layers for users and movies, combined with dot product and bias terms.
- **Training:** Optimized with Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
- **Evaluation:** Using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure prediction performance.

### Results
| Model | MAE |
|--------|------|
| Base Matrix Factorization (50D Embeddings, 5 epochs) | 0.719 |
| Enhanced Matrix Factorization (100D Embeddings, 10 epochs) | 0.697 |

**Path:** `5_movieRating/`
